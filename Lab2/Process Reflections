As embodiment of the robot is crucial for human robot interaction, we focused on the small size of the robot to devise its potential usage.

Despite of its moving ability and servoing, its size make it hard to navigate through floor because of its potential damage and malfunction.
Therefore, we find the use of our robot as moving alarm clock which notifies the time to wake up and keep running from its user so that he/she should wake up from the bed and catch it to turn off the alarm.
Second, we also think that this mobility enables its physical expression by rotating its body. So we simply think of the use of the robot as moving Amazon Alexa.

Therefore, we tried to simply wrap the robot in cylindrical shape that it does not interfere the mobility of the robot. Also, instead of using cardboard, we just simply used A4 paper to reduce the load to the robot motion.
